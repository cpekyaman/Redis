The block with the case statements defines a function which maps integers to strings. 
The match keyword provides a convenient way of applying a function (like the pattern matching function above) to an object. 
Following is a second example which matches a value against patterns of different types

The case classes are special classes that are used in pattern matching with case expressions. Syntactically, 
these are standard classes with a special modifier: case. Following is a simple pattern matching example using case class

Adding the case keyword causes the compiler to add a number of useful features automatically. 
The keyword suggests an association with case expressions in pattern matching.

First, the compiler automatically converts the constructor arguments into immutable fields (vals). 
The val keyword is optional. If you want mutable fields, use the var keyword. 
So, our constructor argument lists are now shorter
