We create a String and call the r( ) method on it. 
Scala implicitly converts the String to a RichString and invokes that method to get an instance of Regex. 
To find a first match of the regular expression, simply call the findFirstIn() method.
If instead of finding only the first occurrence we would like to find all occurrences of the matching word, we can use the findAllIn( ) method 
and in case there are multiple Scala words available in the target string, this will return a collection of all matching words.

You can make use of the mkString( ) method to concatenate the resulting list and you can use a pipe (|) to search small 
and capital case of Scala and you can use Regex constructor instead or r() method to create a pattern as follows
