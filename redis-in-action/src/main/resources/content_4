Based on the data type of a variable, the compiler allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. 
Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables

Fields are variables that belong to an object. 
The fields are accessible from inside every method in the object. 
Fields can also be accessible outside the object depending on what access modifiers the field is declared with. 
Object fields can be both mutable or immutable types and can be defined using either var or val

Method parameters are variables which are used to pass the value inside a method when the method is called. 
Method parameters are only accessible from inside the method but the objects passed in may be accessible from the outside, 
if you have a reference to the object from outside the method. Method parameters are always mutable and defined by val keyword
