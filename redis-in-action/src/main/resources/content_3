A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. 
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, 
but logically the division usually is so each function performs a specific task.

Scala has both functions and methods and we use the terms method and function interchangeably with a minor difference. 
A Scala method is a part of a class which has a name, a signature, optionally some annotations, 
and some bytecode where as a function in Scala is a complete object which can be assigned to a variable. 
In other words, a function which is defined as a member of some object is called a method.
