Consider the following simple example where we assign a string in a variable of type val:

object Test {
   val greeting: String = "Hello, world!"

   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println( greeting )
   }
}
Here the type of the value above is java.lang.String borrowed from Java, because Scala strings are also Java strings. It is very good point to note that every Java class is available in Scala. As such Scala does not have a String class and makes use of Java Strings. So this chapter has been written keeping Java String as a base.

In Scala, as in Java, a string is an immutable object, that is, an object that cannot be modified. On the other hand, objects that can be modified, like arrays, are called mutable objects. Since strings are very useful objects, in the rest of this section we present the most important methods class java.lang.String defines.

Creating Strings:
The most direct way to create a string is to write:

var greeting = "Hello world!";

or

var greeting:String = "Hello world!";
Whenever it encounters a string literal in your code, the compiler creates a String object with its value, in this case, "Hello world!', but if you like you can give String keyword as I have shown you in alternate declaration.

object Test {
   val greeting: String = "Hello, world!"

   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println( greeting )
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces following result:

C:/>scalac Test.scala
C:/>scala Test
Hello, world!

C:/>
As I mentioned earlier, String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make a lot of modifications to Strings of characters then you should use String Builder Classe available in Scala itself.

String Length:
Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as accessor methods. One accessor method that you can use with strings is the length() method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object.

After the following two lines of code have been executed, len equals 17:

object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
      var len = palindrome.length();
      println( "String Length is : " + len );
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces following result:

C:/>scalac Test.scala
C:/>scala Test
String Length is : 17

C:/>
Concatenating Strings:
The String class includes a method for concatenating two strings:

string1.concat(string2);
This returns a new string that is string1 with string2 added to it at the end. You can also use the concat() method with string literals, as in:

"My name is ".concat("Zara");
Strings are more commonly concatenated with the + operator, as in:

"Hello," + " world" + "!"
Which results in:

"Hello, world!"
Let us look at the followinge example:

object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var str1 = "Dot saw I was ";
      var str2 =  "Tod";
      println("Dot " + str1 + str2);
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces following result:

C:/>scalac Test.scala
C:/>scala Test
Dot Dot saw I was Tod

C:/>
Creating Format Strings:
You have printf() and format() methods to print output with formatted numbers. The String class has an equivalent class method, format(), that returns a String object rather than a PrintStream object. Let us look at the followinge example which makes use of printf() method:

object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var floatVar = 12.456
      var intVar = 2000
      var stringVar = "Hello, Scala!"
      var fs = printf("The value of the float variable is " +
                   "%f, while the value of the integer " +
                   "variable is %d, and the string " +
                   "is %s", floatVar, intVar, stringVar)
      println(fs)
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces following result:

C:/>scalac Test.scala
C:/>scala Test
The value of the float variable is 12.456000, while the 
value of the integer var iable is 2000, and the 
string is Hello, Scala!()
